# CS747: Foundations of Intelligent and Learning Agents

This repo contains asssignments done as part of the course [CS747](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/teaching/cs747-a2020/index.html) at IIT Bombay which ran during the Autumn 2020-21 semester.

Each assignment contains the code, scripts for testing the code and a *report.pdf*

* Assignment 1 contains implementations of Epsilon Greedy, KL-UCB, UCB and Thompson Sampling
* Assignment 2 is about finding the optimal policy for a given MDP using algorithms such as Value Iteration, Howard's Policy Iteration and Linear Programming. Solving for the shortest path in a maze is implemented as an example of MDP planning.
* Assignment 3 contains implementation of Sarsa, Expected Sarsa and Q-Learning for the Windy Gridworld task  given as Example 6.5 in Sutton and Barto (2018)
